# Presentations

A repo to hold slide decks and demo code for presentations I make at usergroups and conferences.

If anything doesn't make sense please get in touch.
Demos are based on my normal dev environment, so you may need to change server or instance names to get them to work for you. Again, please get in touch if you run into any issues (or raise an issue on the repo)
